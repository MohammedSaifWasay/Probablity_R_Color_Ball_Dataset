# ðŸŽ² Project 5: Counting and Probability with R

This project explores fundamental probability and counting concepts using R, focusing on practical applications such as ball color/label distributions, drawing probabilities, coin flipping simulations, and factorial calculations. It also includes a challenge section on soccer game win probabilities and combinatorics.

## ðŸ”¢ Probability Calculations

| Scenario                                               | Description                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Drawing a green ball                                   | P(Green) = 192 / Total                          |
| Drawing blue or red                                    | P(Blue âˆª Red)                                   |
| Label A or C                                           | P(A âˆª C)                                        |
| Yellow ball with label D                               | P(Yellow âˆ© D)                                   |
| Yellow ball or label D                                 | P(Yellow âˆª D)                                   |
| Blue followed by red (no replacement)                  | Dependent probabilities                         |
| Four green balls in a row (no replacement)             | Dependent probabilities                         |
| Red followed by label B (no replacement)               | Composite probability                           |

## ðŸ§® Custom Function

- `my_factorial(n)` â€” Implements factorial logic  
  - `my_factorial(0) = 0`  
  - `my_factorial(3) = 6`  
  - `my_factorial(5) = 120`

## ðŸª™ Coin Flip Simulation (Unfair Coin)

- Probability of heads = 0.6, tails = 0.4
- All 16 possible outcomes of flipping the coin 4 times are considered

### ðŸ§® Derived Probabilities

| Outcome Count Description           | Variable         |
|------------------------------------|------------------|
| Probability of exactly 3 heads     | P(X = 3)         |
| Probability of 2 or 4 heads        | P(X = 2 or 4)    |
| Probability of â‰¤ 3 heads           | P(X â‰¤ 3)         |

## âš½ Soccer Game (Optional Challenge)

- 10 games: 5 home (75% win chance), 5 away (50% win chance)

| Scenario                                       | Description                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Probability of exactly 10 wins                 | All wins in both home and away               |
| Probability of more than one win               | P(X > 1)                                     |
| Ways to randomly select 3 home + 2 away wins   | Combinatorics: choosing combinations         |
